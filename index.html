          <h2>Hi,There</h2>
          <p>
            I'm a professional and passionate Front-End Developer focused on
            efficiency and constant learning. Courteous and enthusiastic, I am
            interested in Web Applications and everything in its orbit. I
            fascinated by web programming, developing apps and building
            websites.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am gaining knowledge and ideas working in this area. I am keen to
            gain more experience in the field. My goal is to build applications
            that are scalable and efficient under the hood while providing
            engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences. For this reason, I'm
            looking for a company willing to offer me a placement among its
            developers. In return, I would offer my full commitment, and be a
            pleasant and friendly addition to a team. I am, therefore currently
            looking for a job or an internship as a web developer.
          </p>
          <p>
            I always want to learn more, do more, and be more. I’m also a firm
            believer that we should never settle. I’m hard working, super
            curious, passionate, committed, and also a fast learner!
